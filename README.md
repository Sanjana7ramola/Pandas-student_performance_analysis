# Pandas-student_performance_analysis
In this, I analyzed student performance data to uncover trends affecting academic outcomes. Using  Pandas, I explored attributes like age, gender, study time, and extracurricular participation to understand their impact on final grades. The analysis involved data cleaning, grouping, and aggregation

**Features**

- Data Cleaning: Removed null values, corrected data types, and standardized entries.
- Aggregation and Grouping: Grouped data to analyze performance across different demographics.
- Visualization: Graphs and charts for insights like performance trends, distribution, and correlations.

**Prerequisites**

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.7 or higher**: This project is built with Python, so having Python installed is essential. [Download Python here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

- **Pandas**: A library for data manipulation and analysis. Install it via pip if you haven't:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas
# Dataset
The dataset is available in the `data` folder and is provided as a CSV file.
